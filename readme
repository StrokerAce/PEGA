Title : Pursuer Evader Genetic Algorithm

Author : Matthew Tyler

Description : 

As part of my effort to learn Scala I am re-implementing a simple Genetic Algorithm I developed some years ago.

The Algorithm co-evolves populations of Pursuer and Evader Agents whose fitness is evaluated by competition against eachother.

The main class is com.matthewtyler.pe.gui.PEGuiMainFrame.
